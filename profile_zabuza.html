   <h3><b>Biography:</b></h3>
   <article> Zabuza Momochi is a former member of the 7 Swordsmen of the Mist and the Anbu (Special Purpose Ninja) from Kirigakure - 
    The Village Hidden in the Mist, now a fugitive ninja (nukenin). As a child, not even being a student of the ninja academy, 
    Zabuza infiltrated the genin exam and slaughtered over a hundred students, for which he received the nickname "Demon of the Hidden Mist". 
    Later became an anbu, and then joined the ranks of ? swordsmen of the mist. Zabuza soon met a boy named Haku with special powers and began training him 
    to turn him into his ultimate weapon. Determined to gain power, Zabuza attempted to stage a coup and kill the Fourth Mizukage, but was defeated and fled 
    the village with several associates. Becoming a mercenary, Zabuza began to kill for money to raise funds for a new revolution, then he and Haku met Team 
    7 (Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura) and Kakashi Hatake. 
    It was Zabuza and Haku who inspired Naruto to choose his ninja path and markedly influenced the stage of his growing up.

                <br><article><b>Endurance & survivability:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: meta human.</article>
                <ul>
                    <li> Endurance and a large supply of chakra allow you to fight for several hours without feeling tired, but prefer a quick kill to a protracted fight;</li>
                     <li>- Durability allows you to survive the impact of a huge stream of water jutsu of the great waterfall, capable of demolishing a small building and multi-meter free flight with a blow to a tree;</li>  
                      <li>- High survivability and pain threshold. Even when he was severely injured and both of his arms were crippled by deep stab wounds, Zabuza proved to be a very dangerous opponent, being able to destroy dozens of Gato's specially hired bodyguards and, in the end, Gato himself with a kunai in his mouth, without using his hands.</li>  
                </ul>

                <br><article><b>Intelligence:</b></article>
                <br><article>Intelligence is average, self-confident and arrogant, but skillfully psychologically intimidates his enemies and even allies,
                     he is well versed in anatomy, 
                    Zabuza is an observant opponent, able to analyze the opponent's techniques, having seen them only once.</article>

                <br><article><b>Special and Martial Arts:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: Assasin.</article>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Master of kenjutsu, was in the team of seven swordsmen of the fog of the strongest generation. Also wields standard ninja weapons;</li>
                    </ul>

                <br><article><b>Experience:</b></article>
               <ul>
                <ul>He owns all standard and his own jutsu:</ul>
                   <li> + Substitution Jutsu - the enemy hits Zabuza, but it turns out that the blow was delivered to the log;</li>
                  <li>+ Transformation - temporarily turns into another person or object;</li>  
                   <li> + Illusory Clone. Creates a motionless illusion of himself;</li>  
                   <li> + Shadow Clone (Spawns a shadow clone of himself, the technique dissipates as soon as the clone is hit). The experience gained by the clones is transferred to the owner as soon as the clone disappears;</li>
                <li> + "Shunshin no Jutsu" - the body becomes invisible and almost weightless, gives fast movement over short distances, seems to be teleportation;</li>
                 <li> + The ability to run and stand on vertical surfaces and ceilings, as well as stand on water thanks to the chakra;</li>
                  <li>+ Capable of releasing chakra in the form of an oni demon to intimidate opponents. This chakra, along with madness and bloodlust, caused experienced bandits to disperse in fear;</li>
                    <li>+ Suiton (water technicians) - water management techniques. Generally effective when there is a source of water. Effective against fire techniques, but inferior to earth techniques.</li>
                   <li> + "Water clone" - a clone created from water. A rather weak technique, since the clone's chakra is only 10% of the original, but it consumes much less chakra than the shadow one. The clone is not able to move far from the creator and disappears after being hit by one attack.</li>
                  <li> +"Water Prison Technique" - a technique that locks the opponent in a ball of water. The water in it becomes heavy and hinders the movement of the enemy, getting out of the sphere is quite difficult, but to maintain the technique, Zabuza must touch the ball with his hand. The water bubble is stronger than steel.</li> 
                   <li> +"Water Dragon Projectile Technique" - the technique creates a dragon from water 30 - 50 meters high, which rushes at the enemy. To create a technique, 44 hand seals are required.</li> 
                   <li> +"Water Wall Formation Technique" is a technique that serves to protect. After the seals are sealed, a water barrier protects Zabuza from attacks for a short time. The shield's durability is low, but it allows you to defend against quick or all-round attacks, as you can completely surround yourself with a wall of water.</li>
                  <li> +"Great Waterfall Technique" - the technique creates and controls a huge stream of water, directing it towards the enemy. The flow of water is very powerful, capable of knocking the enemy down and spinning in a whirlpool. The wave size is estimated at several tens of meters;</li>
                  <li> + "Hidden Fog Technique" - a technique in which Zabuza can create fog in a certain area and be invisible to enemies in it. The main technique of Zabuza, a silent assassination specialist. Having disoriented the enemy with a dense fog, 
                    Zabuza throws them from a distance with shuriken or melee attacks, including using clones. Zabuza himself does not see in the fog, 
                    but he accurately orients himself by hearing. The fog is saturated with chakra and even the Sharingan does not help to navigate it;</li>
               </ul>

            <br><article><b>Equipment:</b></article>
                <ul>
                   <li>- Kubikiribocho (decapitator, executioner) - one of the seven legendary swords of the Swordsmen of the Mist. 
                    A special property of the sword is that it uses the blood of its victims to repair damage, thus never becoming dull or jagged. 
                    A very large and heavy two-handed sword approximately two meters long, Zabuza wields it with ease with one hand and is a skilled swordsman. 
                    If necessary, the blade handle can be extended.</li>
                   <li>- Tanto - a short katana;</li> 
                   <li>- Kunai;</li>
